# Netlify build and deploy for Next.js prototype
# https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/next-js/
# In Netlify: set "Base directory" to "prototype" so build runs from prototype/.

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  # Publish dir set by Netlify Next.js plugin when base dir = prototype

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

# If deploying from repo root (no base dir): use base = "prototype", command = "cd prototype && npm ci && npm run build", publish = "prototype/.next"
